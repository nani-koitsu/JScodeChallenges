/*
    Difficulty: Easy    

    Swap two positive variable integers, a and b, without using a temporary variable.

    Before running your code a should be 1 and b should be 2; afterwards, b should be 1 and a should be 2.
    let a = 1;
    let b = 2;
    solution
    a == 2 == true
    b == 1 == true

    Hints:
    1) try to sum and substract
    2) XOR
    3) use array

let a = 1;
let b = 2;

// solution1

a = 1;
b = 2;

// solution2

a = 1;
b = 2;

// solution3

a = 1;
b = 2;
