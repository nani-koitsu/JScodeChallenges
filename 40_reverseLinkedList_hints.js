/*
    Difficulty: Tricky    

    Expand your code from challenge 33 so that it has "reversed()" method that returns a copy of itself in reverse.

    Tip: Don't cheat! Don't reverse the alphabet letters before creating linked list!

    Samples:
    1) let listReversed = list.reversed();
       listReversed.printNodes() == "z y x w v u t s r q p o n m l k j i h g f e d c b a"

    Hints:
    1) use one more Linked List
    2) use copies to set previous node to be next node of current node
