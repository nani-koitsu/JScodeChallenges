/*
    Difficulty: Tricky    

    Create a new data type that models a double-ended queue, or deque. You should be able to push items to the front or back, pop them from the front or back, and get the number of items.

    Samples:
    *Your code*
    let numbers = new Deque();
    numbers.pushBack(5);
    numbers.pushBack(8);
    numbers.pushFront(7);
    numbers.pushBack(3);
    numbers.count      == 4
    numbers.popFront() == 7
    numbers.popBack()  == 3
    numbers.popFront() == 7
    numbers.popFront() == 8
    numbers.popBack()  == null
