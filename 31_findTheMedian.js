    Difficulty: Easy    

    Write an extension to array that accepts an array of Int and returns the median average, or null if there are no values.

    Tip: The mean average is the sum of some numbers divided by how many there are. The median average is the middle of a sorted list. If there is no single middle value – e.g. if there are eight numbers - then the median is the mean of the two middle values.

    Samples:
    [1, 2, 3].solution()          == 2
    [1, 2, 9].solution()          == 2
    [1, 3, 1007, 5, 9].solution() == 5
    [1, 2, 3, 4].solution()       == 2.5
