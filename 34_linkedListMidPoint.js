    Difficulty: Easy    

    Create a linked list of lowercase English alphabet letters, along with a method that traverses all nodes and prints their letters on a single line separated by spaces.

    Tip: 
    1) If linked list contains an even number of items, returning the one before or one after the center is acceptable.

    Samples:
    1) if linked list contains "1, 2, 3, 4, 5"
    list.centerNode() == 3;
    2) if linked list contains "1, 2, 3, 4"
    list.centerNode() == 3 || list.centerNode() == 2;
    3) if linked list contains English alphabet
    list.centerNode() == m || list.centerNode() == "n";
