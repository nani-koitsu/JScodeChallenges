    Difficulty: Easy    

    Extend your linked list class with a new method that returns the node at the mid point of the linked list using no more than one loop.

    Tip: 
    1) If linked list contains an even number of items, returning the one before or one after the center is acceptable.

    Samples:
    1) if linked list contains "1, 2, 3, 4, 5"
    list.centerNode() == 3;
    2) if linked list contains "1, 2, 3, 4"
    list.centerNode() == 3 || list.centerNode() == 2;
    3) if linked list contains English alphabet
    list.centerNode() == m || list.centerNode() == "n";
