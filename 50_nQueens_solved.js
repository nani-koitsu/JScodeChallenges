    Difficulty: Taxing    

    There are "M" different ways you can place "N" queens on an "NxN" chessboard so that none of them are able to capture others. Write a function that calculates them all and prints them to the screen as a visual board layout, and returns the number of solutions it found.

    Tip: A queen moves in straight lines vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. You need to place all eight queens so that no two share the same row, column, or diagonal.

    Samples:
    1) In an 8x8 board you need to place 8 queens. There are 92 possible arrangements, so your function should print each of them then return 92.
    let board  = new Array(8)
    let queens = 0
    solution(board, queens) == 92
    2) In a 10x10 board you need to place 10 queens. There are 724 possible arrangements, so your function should print each of them then return 724.
    board  = new Array(10)
    queens = 0
    solution(board, queens) == 724
