/*
    Difficulty: Taxing    

    Write a function that returns the square root of a positive integer, rounded down to the nearest integer, without using Math.sqrt().

    Samples:
    solution(9)        == 3
    solution(16777216) == 4096
    solution(16)       == 4
    solution(15)       == 3

    Hints:
    1) You can brute force this using a loop from 0 up to the input number.
    2) A more officient solution is to use a binary search.
    3) A rounded down square root will never be more than half its square
    4) If you consider half your input number to be your upper bound, then calculate the mid-point between that and a lower bound thatâ€™s initially 0, you can check whether that mid-point squared gives your input.
    5) If the mid-point is too low, make it the new lower bound then repeat. If the mid-point is too high, make it the new higher bound then repeat.
    6) The square root of number is the same as number in some power.
