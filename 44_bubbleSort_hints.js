    Difficulty: Easy    

    Create an extension for arrays that sort them using bubble sort.

    Tip: A bubble sort repeatedly loops over the items in an array, comparing items that are next to each other and swapping them if they arenâ€™t sorted. This looping continues until all items are in their correct order.

    Samples:
    1) [12, 5, 4, 9, 3, 2, 1].solution() == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12]
    2) ["f", "a", "b"].solution() == ["a", "b", "f"]
    2) [].solution() == []

    Hints:
    1) use one loop nested in another
    1.1) 1st should run 2nd as long as swap is needed
    1.2) 2nd loop should loop through array itself and swap elements if needed
    2) use one loop nested in another
    2.1) 1st loop should run while highest index of sorted element will not become 0
    2.2) 2nd loop should loop through array itself and track index of last swaped element;
    2.3) after running 2nd loop set highest index of sorted element be equal to index of last swaped element
