    Difficulty: Easy    

    Create a linked list of lowercase English alphabet letters, along with a method that traverses all nodes and prints their letters on a single line separated by spaces.

    Tip: 
    1) This is several problems in one. First, create a linked list data structure, which itself is really two things. Second, use your linked list to create the alphabet. Third, write a method traverses all nodes and prints their letters.
    2) You should use a class for this. Yes, really.
    3) Once you complete your solution, keep a copy of the code – you’ll need it for future challenges!

    Samples:
    list.printNodes() == "a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z";
