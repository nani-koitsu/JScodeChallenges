/*
    Difficulty: Tricky    

    Create an extension for arrays that sorts them using the quicksort algorithm.

    Tip: 
    The quicksort algorithm picks an item from its array to use as the pivot point, then splits itself into either two parts (less than or greater than) or three (less, greater, or equal). These parts then repeat the pivot and split until the entire array has been split, then it gets rejoined so that less, equal, and greater are in order.

    Samples:
    1) [12, 5, 4, 9, 3, 2, 1].solution() == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12]
    2) ["f", "a", "b"].solution() == ["a", "b", "f"]
    3) [].solution() == []

    Hints:
    1) use loop to put items in right collection(less, greater, equal)
    2) use filter to remain items for right collection(less, greater, equal)
    3) use recursion
